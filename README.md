### 100 days of Python

In this repo I collected finished tasks from course ["100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

It was done in studying purposes.

The steps for completing course:
1) check the theory
2) get the task
3) resolve the task by me independently
4) recheck how it was done in course and make fixes if it needed

Tasks were done exactly how they expected to be done in course.
