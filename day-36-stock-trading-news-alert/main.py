# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

    ## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME.

## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
#HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

# send mail or send SMS
# as in previous tasks

#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
